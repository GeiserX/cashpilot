## Description

MystNodes (Mysterium Network) is a decentralized VPN and proxy network built on blockchain technology. You earn MYST tokens by running a node that provides VPN, proxy, and data scraping services to users. Requires NET_ADMIN capability and host networking for full functionality. Includes a built-in web UI for node management. Works on both residential and VPS connections.

## Earning Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Monthly range | $0 - $10 (estimate) |
| Per | device |
| Minimum payout | $2 |
| Payout frequency | On request |
| Payment methods | Crypto |

> Earnings in MYST tokens. Residential IPs earn significantly more. Node WebUI at port 4449 for management. VPS accepted. Important: after first run, set your beneficiary (settlement) wallet via the node WebUI or CLI to match your mystnodes.com account -- this links on-chain earnings to your cloud dashboard.

> **One node per public IP.** Mysterium strictly enforces one active node per public IP address. Additional nodes on the same IP show as offline and earn nothing. Do not run on a phone if a Docker node is already running on the same network. Use separate public IPs (e.g. dual WAN, different locations) for additional nodes.

> **Port forwarding recommended.** Forward **UDP 56000-56100** to maximize earnings. Without this, nodes get "Strict NAT" status — many VPN/proxy sessions fail to connect, severely reducing income. Alternatives: enable UPnP on your router (Mysterium uses it automatically), or as last resort, use DMZ. The Docker image runs with `--net host` and `NET_ADMIN` capability.
